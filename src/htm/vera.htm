<h2>Vera is a multiset rewriting system.</h2>

<p>Vera is a multiset rewriting system designed to converse with computers,
created by the same author as <a href='modal.html'>Modal</a>. A program is made
entirely of facts and rules:</p>

<pre>
|| The first character in a file assigns a spacer glyph.

|| A program has rules and facts.
| A rule has a left side | And a right side.

|| An empty rule creates new facts:
|| Facts are separated by commas, a matchbox, a log, paper

| a matchbox | a match, a match, a box
| a match, paper | a flame
| a flame, a log | a warm fire
</pre>

<h3>Facts</h3>
<p>A fact is the name for an item in the multiset, facts are comma separated.</p>
<pre>
|| a fact, another fact
|| one more fact,
	yet another,
	a last fact
</pre>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>A rule is made of a left and right side.</p>
<pre>
| a fact, another fact | the result
| another rule | another result
</pre>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>Each rule is matched against the facts, starting from the first rule, when a
rule's left-hand side is found in the bag, the facts are replaced by the rule's
right-hand side, and match is started from the start. </p>

<pre>
|flour, sugar, apples| apple cake
|apples, oranges, cherries| fruit salad
|fruit salad, apple cake| fruit cake

|| sugar, oranges, apples, apples, cherries, flour
</pre>

<p>Vera will match any amount found in the left-hand side, unlike <a
href='fractran.html'>Fractran</a> which must specify the amount of facts to
match against. The following two rules are equivalent in Vera:</p>

<pre>
| an apple, hunger | a core
| an apple, an apple, an apple, hunger | a core
</pre>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>The language runtime can be implemented in about <a href='ansi_c.html'>200 lines</a>.</p>
