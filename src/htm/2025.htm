	<h2>2025-01-25 Handmade Conference Post-Mortem</h2>

	<p>Some months ago, attendees of the Handmade Seattle conference expressed their
grievances with the conference in regards to its pivoting to include talks with
mentions of social justice awareness and a slightly more diverse panel of
speakers, at the cost of the usual <i>guy-packs-bytes-in-the-right-sequence</i>
talks. Which I have nothing against as someone who tend to give talks of
that exact flavor.</p>

	<p>In any case, the conference organizer apologized for the poor selection of
speakers which did not correspond to the expectations of ticket holders,
promising to resolve the issue in the following year, and in passing, that free
and open source software developers would <a href='https://assets.merveilles.town/media_attachments/files/113/886/295/005/674/393/original/9e6b93f5d01f8c12.mp4' target='_blank'>no longer</a> be welcomed as
speakers.</p>

	<p>I happened to be present in the chatroom when the apology letter went out and
merely questioned whether the choice was really about the lack of
<i>low-level</i> talks, and not something else. It did not take long for
bigots of all sorts to come out and lament the good old days of the conference
and soon the chatroom was ablaze with some pretty vile things against trans
people, this went on for hours without intervention, the usual.</p>

	<p>What I did not expect was for the conference organizer, who ghosted me for
months, to finally break radio silence to slam me for speaking out and
partially blamming me for the unraveling of the conference organization, and
decided against covering the agreed upon travel stipend. I have since
requested for the talk videos to be removed. </p>

	<q>So why is software so terrible?<br />
	We made it terrible.</q>

	<h2>2025-01-11 Langdev January</h2>
	<p>It has become something of a yearly ritual to take the first few days of the
year to write a new implementation of the <a href='drifblim.html'>compiler</a>
I use daily. It serves to see how my programming style and solutions to these
now familiar problems might have evolved, it also ensures that the language
itself doesn't grow beyond what I am capable of implementing in at most a
week's time.</p>
	<p>The most discernible difference in this new implementation, is that it leans
heavily on <a href='uxntal_scope.html'>object-oriented patterns</a>, by
favoring methods acting on private values, over pointer arithmetic by function
application. The stack is principally used as the communication channel between
objects, for example, a text object's buffer is only ever modified through its
explicitly defined capabilities, not by a function taking a text pointer. It
turns out it limits bugs, it is faster and even often smaller!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Reimplemented <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>, OOP style.</li>
		<li>Added autocomplete and a <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/113811222046461898' target='_blank'>few other goodies</a> to <a href='left.html'>Left</a>.</li>
		<li>Created a <a href='https://rabbits.srht.site/days/' target='_blank'>photo sharing website</a> for Hundred Rabbits.</li>
		<li>Enjoyed going back to the gym!</li>
