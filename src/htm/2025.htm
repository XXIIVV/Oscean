	<p>It has become something of a yearly ritual to take the first few days of the
year to write a new implementation of the <a href='drifblim.html'>compiler</a>
I use daily. It serves to see how my programming style and approach to certain
familiar problems might have evolved, and ensures that the language itself
does not grow beyond what I am capable of implementing in at most a week's time.</p>
	<p>The most discernible difference in this new implementation, which leans
heavily on <a href='uxntal_scope.html'>object-oriented patterns</a>, has to do
with favoring methods acting on private values over pointer arithmetic by
function application. The stack is principally used as the communication
channel between objects, for example, a text object's buffer is only ever
modified through its explicitly defined capabilities, not once by a function
taking a text pointer. It turns out it limits bugs, it is faster and even often
smaller!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Reimplemented <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>, OOP style.</li>
		<li>Added autocomplete and a <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/113811222046461898' target='_blank'>few other goodies</a> to <a href='left.html'>Left</a>.</li>
		<li>Created a <a href='https://rabbits.srht.site/days/' target='_blank'>photo sharing website</a> for Hundred Rabbits.</li>
		<li>Enjoyed going back to the gym!</li>
