<h2>A list of Unreleased projects.</h2>

<p>Here are some notes on the reason why I have changed platforms over time, to
learn more see the <a href='https://100r.co/site/story.html'
target='_blank'>Hundred Rabbits story</a>.</p>

<h3 id='unity'>Why Not Unity</h3>
<p>A lot of the abandonned projects were made using the <a
href='unity.html'>Unity game engine</a>, it was a convenient way to bundle
cross-platform applications. The engine's APIs were in flux at the time, and
the rapid migration from one version to the next became more trouble than it
was worth. I also had difficulty versioning, and preserving copies, of these
massive project files. The engine's transition toward a monthly fee had me
looking elsewhere to host my projects.</p> <p>As of January 2015, all Unity
development was abandoned.</p>

<h3 id='mobile'>Why Not iOS</h3>
<p>As I sailed across the Pacific Ocean, it became increasingly clear that
building software for Apple's <a href='mobile.html'>mobile</a> ecosystem was
unsustainable due to the frequent and massive <a
href='obsolescence.html'>toolchain updates</a>, and the need for the latest
generation of Apple devices to successfuly sign and publish to the
platform which are quite hard to aquire in far flung countries.</p>
<p>Trying to maintain our iOS devices outside of western countries, or updating
X Code via expensive or spotty internet was something we could no longer
afford. As of march 2019, all iOS development was abandoned.</p>

<h3 id='javascript'>Why Not Electron</h3>
<p>Subsequent to the iOS development, many applications were migrated to the <a
href='https://www.electronjs.org/' target='_blank'>Electron framework</a> and
web browsers. The entire toolchain, from the necessary internet connection to
access the ever-changing documentation and the energy required for the building
of the massive resulting application, to the bandwidth used for its
publication, was irreconcilable with our studio's solar energy and roaming
connectivity setups.
<p>After a while, I stopped maintaining and using the applications altogether to
preserve energy and bandwidth. As of december 2021, all Electron/HTML5
development was abandoned.</p>
