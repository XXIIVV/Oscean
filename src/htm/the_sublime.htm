<h2>The Sublime refers to a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement, or imitation.</h2>

<p>Wilderness is older than human memory; its beauty owes nothing to human work;
its life is intricate and harmonious beyond human planning.</p>

<q>If there is nothing new on earth, still there is something new in the
heavens. We have always a resource in the skies. They are constantly turning a
new page to view. The wind sets the types in this blue ground, and the
inquiring may always read a new truth</q>
