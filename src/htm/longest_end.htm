<h2>The Longest End is the succeeding Occurrence.</h2>

<p>The <b>Longest End</b> is the longest surviving occurrence among the infinitude of potential timelines. The <a href='soies_machine.html'>Soies machines</a> attempt to locate the pathway toward the longest and final shape of the universe, and force events to occur to get nearer to it.</p>

<p>A boundary, called <i>Maeve's Rope</i>, protects the <i>Longest End</i> from <a href='soies_injection.html'>injections</a> by Soies devices in <a href='feu.html'>competing timelines</a>. A <i>teleogic rugpull</i>, is when a Soies machine makes a sharp change of direction and the observable world suddenly breaks apart, the debris from these events litter the surface of Dinaisth.</p>

<p>Not much is known about the longest end besides its relative location. </p>
