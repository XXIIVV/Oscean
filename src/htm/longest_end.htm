<h2>The Longest End is the succeeding Occurrence.</h2>

<p>The <b>Longest End</b> is the longest surviving occurrence among the infinitude of other potential timelines. The <a href='actors.html'>actors</a> attempt to locate the pathway toward the longest and final shape of the universe, and force events to occur to approach it.</p>

<p>Not much is known about the longest end besides its relative location. A boundary, called <i>Maeve's Rope</i>, protects the <i>Longest End</i> from <a href='soies_injection.html'>injections</a>.</p>
