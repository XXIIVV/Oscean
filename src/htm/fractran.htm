<h2>Fractran is a computer architecture based entirely on the multiplication of fractions.</h2>

<p>A <b>prime</b> is a number that can only be divided by itself one, since these
numbers can't be divided, they can considered the DNA of other numbers. The
factoring of a number into <a href='primes.html'>prime numbers</a>, for example: 18 = 2 × 3<sup>2</sup>,
exposes values which Fractran utilizes as <i>registers</i>. There are two parts to a Fractran program:</p>

	<li><a href='#rules'>The Fractions</a></li>

<h3 id='acc'>The Accumulator</h3>

<table border='1' style='float: right;margin-left: 30px;'>
	<tr><th rowspan='2'>Accumulator</th><th colspan='4'>Registers</th></tr>
	<tr><th>r2</th><th>r3</th><th>r5</th><th>r7</th></tr>
	<tr><th>6</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td></tr>

	<tr><th>1008</th><td>4</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><th>5402250</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <b>Accumulator</b> is a single number whose prime factorization holds the
value of registers(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ..). For example, if the state of
the accumulator is 1008(2⁴ × 3² × 7), r2 has the value 4, r3 has the value
2, r7 has the value 1, and all other registers are unassigned.</p>

<h3>The Fraction</h3>

<img src='../media/refs/fractran.adder1.png' width='140px' style='float:right;margin-left:30px'/>

<p>A <b>Fraction</b> represents an instruction that tests one or more
registers by the prime factors of its numerator and denominator. To evaluate
the result of a rule we take the the accumulator, if multiplying it by this
<a href='fractions.html'>fraction</a> will give us an integer, we will update the accumulator with the
result.</p>

</table>

<p>Operations become more readable when broken down into their primes. We can
think of every prime number as having a register which can take on non-negative
integer values. Each fraction is an instruction that operates on some of the
registers.</p>

<h3 id='notation'>A Notation</h3>

<p>While Fractran is commonly reduced to just another opaque esoteric language,
portraying it as such is doing a disservice to the relatively simple idea at
its core and to the researchers who might otherwise benefit to venture deeper
into a relatively unexplored field of computation.</p>

<p><a href='https://wryl.tech' target='_blank'>Wryl</a>, who created <a href='modal.html'>Modal</a>, demonstrated to me an interesting connection between Fractran and <a href='rewriting.html'>rewriting languages</a> which is made clearer by using a notation where prime registers are automatically assigned names, and fractions are defined in terms of transformations of these names:</p>

<pre style='clear:both'>
:: left side > right side  <i>15/6 left.2 side.3 > side.3 right.5</i>

AC 6 left side  <i>accumulator</i>
00 6 × 15/6 = 15, side right  <i>result</i>
</pre>

<p>This documentation will represent registers with names(x, y, foo-bar, baz, ..). Fractions will be
written as rewrite rules starting with <code>::</code>, a left-side, a
spacer(>) and a right-side. The notation indicates which registers to replace
on the denumerator left-side, and what to replace them with on the numerator right-side. Unlike John Conway's original specification of Fractran, fractions are <a href='#strict'>not reduced</a>.</p>

<q>Multiset sounds too technical.<br />
Dijkstra's bag, not technical enough.</q>

<img src='../media/refs/fractran.multiply.png' width='220px'/>

<h3>Programming In Fractran</h3>

<p>In a rule definition, which is a fraction where prime factorization is written as names, we find names to the left-side of the spacer(>) to be rewritten by names found on the right-side. Each new name is added to the dictionary and represented internally as a prime number.</p>

<pre>
:: flour sugar apples > apple-cake
:: apples oranges cherries > fruit-salad
:: fruit-salad apple-cake > fruit-cake

sugar oranges apples cherries flour apples
</pre>

<p>Rules are tested in a sequence from the first to the last, when a rewrite rule gives us an integer when when multiplied by the accumulator, the accumulator is updated by the product of that multiplication, and search for the next rule starts back again from the beginning.</p>

<pre>
:: 7/30 flour.2 sugar.3 apples.5 > apple-cake.7 
:: 17/715 apples.5 oranges.11 cherries.13 > fruit-salad.17 
:: 19/119 apple-cake.7 fruit-salad.17 > fruit-cake.19 

AC 21450 flour sugar apples apples oranges cherries 
00 21450 × 7/30 = 5005, apples apple-cake oranges cherries 
01 5005 × 17/715 = 119, apple-cake fruit-salad 
02 119 × 19/119 = 19, fruit-cake 
</pre>

<p>In other words, it helps to visualize the fractions in a program as a list of rewrite rules that tests the accumulator against its left-side, and starts back at the top of the list after updating the accumulator when it is a match, or keep going when it does not.</p>

<q>Fractran has a single operation, and can be explained in 10 seconds.</q>

<ul>
    <li>For each fraction in a list for which the multiplication of the accumulator and the fraction is an integer, replace the accumulator by the result of that multiplication.</li>
    <li>Repeat this rule until no fraction in the list produces an integer when multiplied by the accumulator, then halt.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's all!</p>

<h3>Loops</h3>

<p>Loops are a useful and common construct in programming, here is an example program in the imperative style that cycles through the four seasons for two years until it reaches the autumn of the second year:</p>

<pre>
while(year++) {
	for(season = 0; season < 4; season++) {
		if(year == 2 && season == 3)
			print("Second autumn");
			return;
	}
}
</pre>

<p>To create a loop, a rewriting program relies on cycling back onto a term and the boundary of a loop is done by catching the ending case. Now, if we translate the above program into rewrite rules:</p>

<pre>
:: year year autumn > "Second Autumn"

:: spring > summer
:: summer > autumn
:: autumn > winter
:: winter > spring year

spring
</pre>

<p>Looking at the trace of the evaluation, we can see the following transformations:<p>

<pre>
AC 7, spring 
01 7 × 11/7 = 11, summer 
02 11 × 3/11 = 3, autumn 
03 3 × 13/3 = 13, winter 
04 13 × 14/13 = 14, year spring 
01 14 × 11/7 = 22, year summer 
02 22 × 3/11 = 6, year autumn 
03 6 × 13/3 = 26, year winter 
04 26 × 14/13 = 28, year^2 spring 
01 28 × 11/7 = 44, year^2 summer 
02 44 × 3/11 = 12, year^2 autumn 
00 12 × 5/12 = 5, Second Autumn
</pre>


<h3>Arithmetic & Logic</h3>

<p>The <b>sum</b> of two registers(x+y) can be reached by moving the value of one register into the other:</p>

<pre>
:: y > x

AC 144 x^4 y^2
00 144 × 2/3 = 96, x^5 y
00 96 × 2/3 = 64, x^6
</pre>

<p>The <b>difference</b> between two registers(x-y) can be reached by consuming the value of two registers at once, and moving the remains to the first if we want the result inside x:</p>

<pre>
:: x y >
:: y > x

AC 576 x^6 y^2
00 576 × 1/6 = 96, x^5 y 
00 96 × 1/6 = 16, x^4
</pre>

<p>The <b>doubling</b> of a register(x*2) can be reached by using a temporary <i>catalyst</i> register which keeps the evaluation in a specific state.To keep the accumulator size small, we can reserve lower registers by creating a pseudo-rule without a right-side:</p>

<pre>
:: x A
:: double x > double A A 
:: double   > 
:: A A > x x

AC 80, x^4 double 
00 80 × 45/10 = 360, x^3 A^2 double 
00 360 × 45/10 = 1620, x^2 A^4 double 
00 1620 × 45/10 = 7290, x A^6 double 
00 7290 × 45/10 = 32805, A^8 double 
01 32805 × 1/5 = 6561, A^8 
02 6561 × 4/9 = 2916, x^2 A^6 
02 2916 × 4/9 = 1296, x^4 A^4 
02 1296 × 4/9 = 576, x^6 A^2 
02 576 × 4/9 = 256, x^8 
</pre>

<p>The <b>halving</b> of a register(x/2) can be reached by keeping a <i>catalyst</i> register and a temporary accumulator(A)</p>

<pre>
:: x A
:: half x x > half A
:: half     > 
:: A > x

AC 320, x^6 half 
00 320 × 15/20 = 240, x^4 A half 
00 240 × 15/20 = 180, x^2 A^2 half 
00 180 × 15/20 = 135, A^3 half 
01 135 × 1/5 = 27, A^3 
02 27 × 2/3 = 18, x A^2 
02 18 × 2/3 = 12, x^2 A 
02 12 × 2/3 = 8, x^3
</pre>

<p>Logic in rewrite rules is typically implemented as multiple rules, where each one is a potential location in the <a href='logic.html'>truth table</a>, here is <b>logical and</b> between two registers(x&y) as example:</p>

<pre>
:: and x y > true
:: and x   > false
:: and y   > false

AC 30, and x y 
00 30 × 7/30 = 7, true
</pre>

<p>The comparison operation <b>greather-than</b> of two registers(x>y) can be implemented in a non-destructive way that doesn't consume the inputs and returns the program to its initial state with the answer.</p>

<pre>
:: gth x y > gth A 
:: gth x   > gth? true x 
:: gth     > gth? false 
:: gth? A  > gth? x y 
:: gth?    > 

AC 20250, gth x^4 y^3 
00 20250 × 14/30 = 9450, gth x^3 y^2 A 
00 9450 × 14/30 = 4410, gth x^2 y A^2 
00 4410 × 14/30 = 2058, gth x A^3 
01 2058 × 429/6 = 147147, x A^3 gth? true 
03 147147 × 165/77 = 315315, x^2 y A^2 gth? true 
03 315315 × 165/77 = 675675, x^3 y^2 A gth? true 
03 675675 × 165/77 = 1447875, x^4 y^3 gth? true 
04 1447875 × 1/11 = 131625, x^4 y^3 true
</pre>

<p id='combinations'>Now, let's put it all together! Programs are made of the combination of operations. In rewrite systems, we need to ensure that the evaluation is done in the right order, which is not necessarily the order in which rules are defined. Say we want to get the result of the following nested operations:</p>

<pre>
(- (+ 2 (* 4 6)) (+ 3 5 7))
</pre>

<p>We've looked at a handful of arithmetic operations, we'll add catalysts(mul, add, sub, etc..) in order to make them reusable in a larger context, and create a state-machine that will run the combination of operations in the correct sequence. Here is how a larger program can be organized, including comments within parenthesis for the various functions:</p>

<pre>
:: res x y z A t

<i>(mul x y .. res=x*y)</i>
	:: mul.move A > mul.move y
	:: mul.move   > mul
	:: mul x y    > mul x A res
	:: mul x      > mul.move
	:: mul y      > mul
	:: mul > 

<i>(add x y z .. res=x+y+z)</i>
	:: add x > add res
	:: add y > add res
	:: add z > add res
	:: add > 

<i>(sub x y .. res=x-y)</i>
	:: sub x y > sub
	:: sub x   > sub res
	:: sub >

<i>(moving intermediate results)</i>
	:: res-x res > res-x x :: res-x > 
	:: res-t res > res-t t :: res-t > 
	:: res-y res > res-y y :: res-y > 
	:: t-x t > t-x x :: t-x > 

<i>(main)</i>
	:: 1) > mul x x x x y y y y y y res-x 2)
	:: 2) > add y y res-t 3)
	:: 3) > add x x x y y y y y z z z z z z z res-y t-x 4)
	:: 4) > sub

AC 47, 1)
.. 
12 59392 × 1/29 = 2048, res^11 
</pre>

<h3 id='fib'>Example: Fibonacci</h3>

<p>Let's have a look at a <i>real program</i> to generate the Fibonacci Sequence(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34..). This program uses catalysts(fib, fib.shift, fib.move) to keep the program state which has 3 phases(shift, move and back to fib) and ensures the correct evaluation order:</p>

<pre>
<i>(Keep going while the n register is present)</i>

:: fib n > fib.shift

<i>(Shift the scrolling window to show two numbers)</i>

:: fib.shift last > fib.shift B
:: fib.shift res  > fib.shift A B
:: fib.shift      > fib.move

<i>(Move the temporary registers back by one number)</i>

:: fib.move A > fib.move last
:: fib.move B > fib.move res
:: fib.move   > fib

<i>(Cleanup temporary registers at the end of the program)</i>

:: last > 
:: fib  > 

<i>(Find the fib number equal to the value in n register)</i>

AC 6240, n^5 last res fib

08 15869140625 × 1/13 = 1220703125, res^13 
</pre>

<h3>Example: Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>

<p>Fractran's <b>output</b> capability is limited to the resulting accumulator at the end of an evaluation. The advantage of symbolic rewriting is that registers are already assigned names, so we shall print those instead. As for <b>input</b>, we can type in new symbol tokens and appending their value to the accumulator between evaluations. We can implement a <i>tic-tac-toe</i> in a mere 16 rules:</p>

<pre>
<i>(Reserve the first registers for the player moves)</i>

:: x#a o#a x#b o#b x#c o#c
:: x#d o#d x#e o#e x#f o#f
:: x#g o#g x#h o#h x#i o#i

<i>(This register remains active until the game ends)</i>

game

<i>(A symbol to draw the value of registers in a grid)</i>

"

  Set move in the format x#a, o#b, x#c, etc:

  a b c  |  {x#a o#a .} {x#b o#b .} {x#c o#c .}
  d e f  |  {x#d o#d .} {x#e o#e .} {x#f o#f .}
  g h i  |  {x#g o#g .} {x#h o#h .} {x#i o#i .}

 "

<i>(Rules for each possible victory states)</i>

:: game x#a x#b x#c > x#a x#b x#c "Player X wins!" 
:: game o#a o#b o#c > o#a o#b o#c "Player O wins!"
:: game x#d x#e x#f > x#d x#e x#f "Player X wins!" 
:: game o#d o#e o#f > o#d o#e o#f "Player O wins!"
:: game x#g x#h x#i > x#g x#h x#i "Player X wins!" 
:: game o#g o#h o#i > o#g o#h o#i "Player O wins!"
:: game x#a x#e x#i > x#a x#e x#i "Player X wins!" 
:: game o#a o#e o#i > o#a o#e o#i "Player O wins!"
:: game x#g x#e x#c > x#g x#e x#c "Player X wins!" 
:: game o#g o#e o#c > o#g o#e o#c "Player O wins!"
:: game x#a x#d x#g > x#a x#d x#g "Player X wins!" 
:: game o#a o#d o#g > o#a o#d o#g "Player O wins!"
:: game x#b x#e x#h > x#b x#e x#h "Player X wins!" 
:: game o#b o#e o#h > o#b o#e o#h "Player O wins!"
:: game x#c x#f x#i > x#c x#f x#i "Player X wins!" 
:: game o#c o#f o#i > o#c o#f o#i "Player O wins!"
</pre>

<p>Program don't need to specify anything other than these 16 rules, as players can already input their moves in the format of its register names: x#a, o#b, x#c, etc.</p>

<pre>
  Set move in the format x#a, o#b, x#c, etc:

  a b c  |  x o o
  d e f  |  . x .
  g h i  |  . . x

  Player X wins!
</pre>

<p>A Fractran program specifies the wiring and logic of an interactive application, registers point to symbols in memory and so the bytecode itself is never localized as these strings reside in the application's front-end far from its logic.</p>

<h3>Example: Fizzbuzz</h3>

<p>Alternatively to getting the resulting program state at the end of an evaluation, we can emit the accumulator at a specific rate during the evaluation by checking if a register is active or not.</p>

<pre>
<i>(Reserve the first registers for the increments and base-10)</i>

:: +5 +3
:: 1# 2# 3# 4# 5# 6# 7# 8# 9# 0

<i>(Leave the printing register for no more than one rewrite)</i>

:: print: fizz >
:: print: buzz >
:: print: fizzbuzz >
:: print: "{1# 2# 3# 4# 5# 6# 7# 8# 9# 0}{1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}" >

<p>During the evaluation, these 27 fractions will toggle <code>r79(print:)</code> giving us a trigger when the accumulator state might be read. This is demonstrated here as an alternative approach for emitting programs and debugging where the runtime is masking lower registers to the printing register.</p>

<h3 id='stack'>Nested Stack Machines</h3>

<p>A <a href='concatenative.html'>stack-machine</a> can be implemented in Fractran, but it's <i>not for the faint of heart</i>. This computation model keeps an entire program state in a single number, and the following stack machine allocates a whole stack into a single register of that number. The theory is that it is possible to keep a stack of zeros and ones in a single register using a <a href='binary.html#stack'>binary encoding</a> for that number.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pushing a <kbd>0</kbd> onto the stack is equivalent to doubling the number.</li>
	<li>Pushing a <kbd>1</kbd> is equivalent to doubling and adding 1.</li>
	<li>Popping is equivalent to dividing by 2, where the remainder is the number.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we begin with <b>push</b>, we can see that we are doubling the x register, same as demonstrated above. After the evaluation, our LIFO stack has a value of 30, and is equal to <kbd>1</kbd> <kbd>1</kbd> <kbd>1</kbd> <kbd>0</kbd>, where the right-most one is the item on top. Now, for <b>pop</b>, we can halve the x register, again, same as demonstrated above, and keeping the result of the value in a register for 0, and a register for 1.</p>

<pre>
:: push 1 x > A A push 1
:: push 1 > x
:: push 0 x > A A push 0
:: push 0 >

:: pop x x > A pop
:: pop x   > 1
:: pop     > 0

:: A A > x x
:: A > x
<i>
x    push 1 = x^3
x^3  push 1 = x^7
x^7  push 1 = x^15
x^13 push 0 = x^30

x^30 pop : 0 x^15
x^15 pop : 1 x^7
x^7  pop : 1 x^3
x^3  pop : 1 x</i>
</pre>

<p>We can build on these two primitives and define temporary register to keep the result of popping, extra stack operations <b>dup</b> and <b>swap</b>, and a little state-machine to input some of these commands:</p>

<pre>
:: ?#a 0 > 0#a :: ?#a 1 > 1#a
:: ?#b 0 > 0#b :: ?#b 1 > 1#b

:: dup > pop ?#a dup-next
:: dup-next 0#a > 0#a 0#a push-a push-a 
:: dup-next 1#a > 1#a 1#a push-a push-a 

:: swap > swap-next pop ?#a 
:: swap-next > swap-last pop ?#b push-a
:: swap-last > push-b

:: push-a 0#a > push 0
:: push-a 1#a > push 1
:: push-b 0#b > push 0
:: push-b 1#b > push 1

:: 1) > push 1 2) <i>1</i>
:: 2) > push 1 3) <i>1 1</i>
:: 3) > push 1 4) <i>1 1 1</i>
:: 4) > push 0 5) <i>1 1 1 0</i>
:: 5) > swap   6) <i>1 1 0 1</i>
:: 6) > dup       <i>1 1 0 1 1</i>

<h3 id='strict'>Catalysts Support</h3>

<p>Fractran traditionally compares the accumulator against <a href='fractions.html#reduction'>reduced fractions</a>, but computationally-speaking, getting to the gcd of a fraction does little more than getting rid of otherwise valuable information used during comparison to match against a <b>restricted set of fractions</b>. A strict mode allows for <a href='rewriting.html#catalyst'>catalysts</a> which are symbols found on both sides of a rewrite rule.</p>

<p>The following two fractions are not equal and reducing the first into the second, eliminates the capability to match against it <b>only</b> when the catalyst <code>green</code> is present in the accumulator:</p>

<pre>
:: 15/6 red green > green blue
:: 5/2 red > blue

red green
</pre>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>A basic implementation of the Fractran runtime core is a mere 20 lines of code:</p>

<div class='codeview'>
	<iframe src='../etc/framin.c.txt' style='height:315px'></iframe>
	<pre>cc framin.c -o framin <a href='../etc/framin.c.txt' target='_blank'>view raw</a></pre>
</div>

<p>An implementation of the full symbolic runtime is about <a href='ansi_c.html'>300
lines</a>:</p>

<div class='codeview'>
	<iframe src='../etc/fractran.c.txt'></iframe>
	<pre>cc fractran.c -o fractran <a href='../etc/fractran.c.txt' target='_blank'>view raw</a></pre>
</div>

<!--
<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Fractran operators are <a href='reversible_computing.html'>reversible</a>, meaning that some programs can be run backward, back to its original state. To undo an operation, evaluation is undone by inverting the numerator and denumerator:</p>

<pre>
AC 19, fruit-cake
02 19 × 119/19 = 119, apple-cake fruit-salad
01 119 × 715/17 = 5005, apples apple-cake oranges cherries
00 5005 × 30/7 = 21450, apples apples flour sugar oranges cherries
</pre>
