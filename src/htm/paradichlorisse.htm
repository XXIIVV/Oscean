<h2>Paradichlorisse looks like a ribbon.</h2>

<p>Living deep beneath the surface of the <a href='es.html'>Es plains</a>, snaking through and across <a href='dinaisth.html'>Dinaisth</a>, Paradichlorisse's ribbon-like body is reflecting moments from anywhere within the <a href='soies.html'>Occurring</a>, in such details that the fractal appears, to the observer, in higher definition than presence itself.</p>

<p>A lesser impression of an encounter with Paradichlorisse would be akin to picking up a book, and in vivid details, before your eyes is the story of your own picking up of that book, and the narration of the confusion that ensued.</p>

<p>An unfortunate mortal glancing at Paradichlorisse, would immediately collapse, unable to pull away. The narration of the current moment would feel more real than existence itself and ensnare them in a vision from which they would not be able find their way back out of the story of their death.</p>

<p>When Paradichlorisse spoke of silence, silence fell.</p>

<q>It is because I cannot see what you see that I can see at all.</q>
