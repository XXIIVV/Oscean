<h2>Keyboard 468 was a 18-keys keyboard.</h2>

<p>The letters are <b>sorted by frequency</b> in the English language, and their
likeliness to follow the last input character.</p>
<p>The purpose of this experimental keyboard is to have a keyboard displaying
large letters, making it so you only ever need to <b>type using the two rows at
the top</b>, maximizing the space and allowing for big large letters. The
hidden letters are accessible through the <i>alt</i> key, alongside symbols and
numbers.</p>
