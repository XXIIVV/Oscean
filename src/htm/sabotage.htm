<h2>Sabotage means primarily: the withdrawal of efficiency</h2>

<p>Luddism was a working-class movement opposed to the political consequences of
industrial capitalism. The Luddites wanted <a
href='technology.html'>technology</a> to be deployed in ways that made work
more humane and gave workers more <a href='technocracy.html'>autonomy</a>. The
bosses, on the other hand, wanted to drive down costs and <a
href='commodity.html'>increase productivity</a>. Smashing looms and stocking
frames was the tactic, not their goal. Their goal was to challenge not the
technology itself, but rather the social relations that governed its use.</p>

<p>A neo-Luddite movement would understand no technology is sacred in itself,
but is only worthwhile insofar as it benefits society. It would confront the
harms done by digital capitalism and seek to address them by giving people more
power over the technological systems that structure their lives.</p>

<q>Every society has the criminals it deserves.</q>

<p>By refusing to collaborate with an oppressive order, by creating forms of
resistance to any order that perpetuated massacres, devalued us as human
beings, atomised societies and imperilled our very existence, we could then
perhaps hope to salvage man from a conformist <i>throwaway culture</i>.</p>
