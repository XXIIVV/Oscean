<h2>The Hipster PDA is typically notesheets in a binder clip.</h2>

<p>Stacking four zines in a binder clip gives a quick DIY notebook with
refillable pages. It's a useful everyday carry for folks who don't have
a smartphone.</p>

<p>I carry mine everywhere, and I cut a Bic pen to match the height of the
zine. In it, I write various workout routines, grocery lists, random things
people mention to me to watch or read.</p>
