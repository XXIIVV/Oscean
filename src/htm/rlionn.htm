<h2>Rlionn periodically manifests in Laeisth.</h2>

<p>Rlionn is not a single individual but a trait that manifests itself in the
travelers who wander near the <a href='laeisth.html'>Oasis of Laeisth</a>. It
is experienced as a trance driving its host to embark on a walk across the
desert toward <a href='paradichlorisse.html'>Paradichlorisse</a>. During these
<i>walks</i> in which one becomes a vessel for Rlionn to physically interact with the
world, the afflicted has momentary control over the dream world from which
Rlionn originates.</p>

<p>Spoken-of in tales and songs, the stories of Rlionn and the procession of its
subjects are sung in the album <a href='children_of_bramble.html'>Children Of
Bramble</a>. Rlionn's reach doesn't extend beyond the shores of the Laeisth
continent, and so Rlionn never effectively reach its destination, it only
leaves stranded and confused sleepwalkers in the wastes.</p>
