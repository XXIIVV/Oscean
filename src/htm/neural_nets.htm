<h2>In a neural net, neurons are used as computational units.</h2>

<p>A <b>neuron</b> has a given number of incoming and outgoing connections to other neurons, it gives out an output that stimulates or inhibits other neurons when the sum of its inputs goes over a threshold arity value. A neuron with an arity of zero will always fire.</p>

<h3>A Notation</h3>

<p>Typically, neural networks are programmed with flow diagrams, I found those to be prone to clutter. Instead, this documentation will use a rule-based textual representation, which allows networks to be created more rapidly and precisely.</p>

<pre>
A neuron*. <i style='float:right'>neuron/0</i>
</pre>

<p>In a rule, a neuron is specified by ending a word with a star, an excitatory connection is separated by a colon, an inhibitory connection is separated by a semi-colon, a rule is terminated by a comma, everything else is ignored. For example, the <code>fire/2</code> neuron is the same as the drawing above.</p>

<pre>
I have matches*, and some kindling*:
	I can make a fire*. <i style='float:right'>fire/2</i>

But if it's raining*;
	I cannot make a fire*.

I have matches* and kindling*. <i style='float:right'>matches/0, kindling/0</i>
</pre>

<p>For each step of the evaluation, the <code>matches/0</code> and <code>kindling/0</code> will send excitatory signals to the <code>fire/2</code> neuron.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>An implementation of the full symbolic runtime is about <a href='ansi_c.html'>150
lines</a>:</p>

</div>

<p>By virtue of the similarities this system shares with other <a href='rewriting.html'>rewriting systems</a>, by being programmed by specifying rules and an initial state, resembles a rewriting language enough that I thought it should classified as such.</p>
