<h2>Neural nets is a system in which neurons are used as computational units.</h2>

<p>While not exactly a rewriting system per-say, the way these systems are programmed resembles a rewriting language enough that I thought it should be here.</p>

<h3>Neurons</h3>
<p>A McCulloch-Pitts neuron has many input connections to the output of other neurons in a neural network. It gives an output that stimulates other neurons when the sum of its inputs goes over a threshold value.</p>

<p>The rule for its operation is that at time t it looks at its excitatory inputs and counts up the number of ones present. If the count is equal to or greater than the threshold AND the inhibitory input is zero then at time t+1 the cell outputs a one, otherwise it outputs a zero.</p>
<ol>
	<li>a cell which can output a 0 or a 1</li>
	<li>a number of excitatory inputs</li>
	<li>a single inhibitory input</li>
	<li>a threshold value</li>
</ol>

<h3>WORK IN PROGRESS.. come back tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>An implementation of the full symbolic runtime is about <a href='ansi_c.html'>150
