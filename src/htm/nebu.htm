<h2>A spreadsheet editor.</h2>

<p>Nebu is a graphical spreadsheet editor for the <a
href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a> system, designed to read and write <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values' target="_blank">csv
files</a>. Math operations between cells are done by specifying a range of
cells. </p>

<p>A range uses the colon character between two cell values, operations are made
by specifying a range, followed by one of 4 arithmetic operator(+, -, *, /).
For example: <kbd>A5:C7*</kbd>. There are also 2 extra operators(#, ") to get the
length of a rectangle, and string concatenation. If an operator is not specified, it will
default to returning the sum. </p>
