<h2>A catclock, uh.</h2>

<p>This <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a> implementation of the catclock was
created in collaboration with <a href='rekka.html'>Rekka Bellum</a>. </p>

<p>Catclock is originally a X10 program by Tony Della Fera, Dave Mankins, Ed Moy, Deanna Hohn and Philip Schneider, crafted for entertainment, in the late 1980's. It was also ported to the <a href='plan9.html'>Plan 9</a> operating system by Tom Duff, which is where I first came across the catclock.</p>
