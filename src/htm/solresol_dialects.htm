<h2>Variance in Solresol dialects</h2>

<p>There are multiple versions of Solresol, and they each have minor differences. Currently, there are three small variations on the language, each of which mostly edit vocabulary and a small amount of the grammar. </p>

<ul>
	<li><b>François Sudre</b>: Original specs. <i>Fasol</i>: Voici.</li>
	<li><b>Boleslas Gajewski</b>: Revised specs. <i>Fasol</i>: Why?</li>
	<li><b>Modern Solresol</b>: Community specs. <i>Sisol</i>: Honorific Particle.</li>
	<li><b>Symmetric Solresol</b>: Wiktopher specs. <i>Mido</i>: Your(sing).</li>
</ul>

<p>Symmetrical tries to address a few issues at once. Its central focus is to facilitate the learning of the language and its communication by clustering similar words together by using Solresol's reversion tool, so one need only learn <i>wet</i> to know how to spell <i>dry</i>. The second goal of the language is to remove artifacts of the French language present in the grammar and vocabulary to begin approaching the language's original point of doing away with low-hanging linguistic biases.</p>

<article>
	<p>Which dialect are we speaking? To know if you are communicating with another speaker of Symmetric, you may say "<i>dosol, soldo?</i>" to mean "We, ours?" which have no obvious meaning in other dialects.</p>
</article>

<h3>Symmetry</h3>

<p>A unique feature of Solresol is that it can express opposite meanings by reversing the words, syllable by syllable. For instance <i>fala</i> means <i>good or tasty</i>, and <i>lafa</i> means <i>bad</i>. Unfortunately, this attribute was used only occasionally in the table of two syllables, mostly abandoned in the table of tree syllables, and altogether ignored beyond.</p>

<article>
	<p><b>Symmetrical</b>: Every word of the two-syllables table is reversible except for the question words. Pronouns are reversed to their possessive forms(you, yours). And most non-special words of three syllables are reversible.</p>
</article>

<h3 id='gender'>Gender</h3>

<p>In traditional Solresol, grammatical categories are distinguished by the position of an accent over the notes, which means the note should be lengthened to indicate stress. A verb is unstressed throughout, the noun is stressed on the first note, the adjective on the next-to-last, and the adverb on the last. The feminine is also marked by final stress. By default, all animate nouns and pronouns imply that they are of male sex. To differentiate the female sex, a bar, hyphen or macron is added to the final syllable of the corresponding article or the word itself. </p>

<p>In modern Solresol, pronouns do not change depending on gender. The
definitions of <span class='note_si'>si</span><span class='note_la'>la</span>
and <span class='note_la'>la</span><span class='note_si'>si</span> are part of
an honorifics system inspired by what is used in <a
href='japanese.html'>Japanese</a>; both are gender-neutral titles, one to be
respectful, and one to be affectionate.</p>

<article>
	<p><b>Symmetrical</b>: Is non-gendered, the original versions of the language overly emphasize men with words like mister and bachelor, present in the two letter estate, these are all gone.</p>
</article>

<h3 id='christianity'>Christianity</h3>

<p>There are many words of 3 syllables relating to Christianity(holy trinity, virgin mary, etc..) cluttering the prized real-estate.</p>

<article>
	<p><b>Symmetrical</b>: These words have been replaced to make space for symmetries.</p>
</article>

<h3>Ses</h3>

<p>A condensed way to use Solresol conversationally is called <i>Ses</i>(Solresol) in which the notes are given a representative consonant and vowel (or diphthong). The most basic words use the vowel alone; all others begin with a consonant followed by a vowel (or diphthong), etc.</p>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><td class='note_do'>do</td><td>p</td><td>o</td></tr>
	<tr><td class='note_re'>re</td><td>k</td><td>e</td></tr>
	<tr><td class='note_mi'>mi</td><td>m</td><td>i</td></tr>
	<tr><td class='note_fa'>fa</td><td>f</td><td>a</td></tr>
	<tr><td class='note_sol'>sol</td><td>s</td><td>u</td></tr>
	<tr><td class='note_la'>la</td><td>l</td><td>au</td></tr>
	<tr><td class='note_si'>si</td><td>r</td><td>ai</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In this way, one can write or pronounce words such as these:</p>

<ul>
	<li>do &gt; o (v) - no</li>
	<li>re &gt; e (v) - and</li>
	<li>fa-la &gt; fau (cv) - good</li>
	<li>la-fa &gt; la (cv) - bad</li>
	<li>mi-ti-sol-do &gt; maiso (cvcv) - experience</li>
	<li>sol-sol-re-do &gt; suko (cvcv) - migraine</li>
	<li>do-la-fa-sol &gt; paufu (cvcv) - soup</li>
	<li>sol-re-sol &gt; ses (cvc) - language (solresol)</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Comparison</h3>

<p>Siré misolredo faremi doredore domisómi re misóla, solfalafá dósila re réfasi. Dófa faremi remila fare dômilafa re dôfasifa, re fafa fasolfa midolǎ fare mîredofa lasi sîmisila.</p>

<p>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.</p>

<!-- There are very few words of three letters and instead, sentences rely heavily on auxiliary verbs(to cook, to make food).  -->
