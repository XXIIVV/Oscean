<h2>Markl is a puzzle game in development.</h2>

<p><b>Markl</b> is a game in which the world is navigated by selecting your
character's movements in advance, and solving the puzzles by utilizing the
movement modifyers available in the environment.</p> 

<article>
	<p>The project was initially built as a web application in 2018, and was put on
hold until a more suitable host was available. Soon after the freezing of the
Uxn specification, the work on the game was resumed.</p>
