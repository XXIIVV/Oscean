<h2>Rewriting languages are typically made of rules and a starting state.</h2>

<p>These languages often have two phases; the first gives <b>a set of rules</b>, and the second provides <b>an input</b> objects on which those rules are to be applied, sometimes called the <i>Accumulator</i>. For example, a program for a string rewriting system with wildcards begins with a series of rules which define strings to match, a relation(>), and the resulting transformation.</p>

<pre>
<i>rule</i>    swap ?x ?y > ?y ?x
<i>input</i>   swap foo bar
<i>output</i>  bar foo
</pre>
