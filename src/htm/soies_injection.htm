<h2>A Soies Injection is a synthetic event forced into happening by compressing events outside of the Occurring.</h2>

<p>Injections are unnatural events found near the <a href='longest_end.html'>Longest End</a>, manufactured by condensing the potential events outside of the occurring. The <a href='andes_castel.html'>andes castel</a> found in <a href='laeisth.html'>laeisth</a> is a known <b>injection</b>, the <a href='neon_hermetism.html'>Neon Hermetists</a> suggest the <a href='ehrivevnv.html'>Ehrivevnv</a> to also be an injection.</p>
<p>For example, constructing a complex synthetic structure by retroactively, or teleologically, hijacking natural processes such as erosion or wind across immense spans of time, by consuming the near-infinite possibilities neighboring the occurring.</p>
<p>The machines capable of producing such events are called <a href='soies_machine.html'>Soies Machines</a>.</p>
