<h2>Assorted notes on the English language.</h2>

<h3>Thorn</h3>

<p>þ and Þ (thorn): In Modern English we represent the sounds 
  at the beginning of the word "the" and end of the word "with" 
  with the digraph "th" ("digraph" is a technical term meaning 
  two letters used to represent one sound). Old English had two separate letters 
  for the "th" sound. The first is written like this: þ . It is called 
  "thorn".</p>

<p>ð and Ð (eth): Old English scribes could also represent
the "th" sound with the letter ð (the capital letter version looks
like a capital D with a short horizontal line cutting the vertical line
at the left side of the letter in half: Ð). The letter is called "eth,"
pronounced so that it rhymes with the first syllable in the word "feather."</p>

<p>Thorn and eth are used interchangeably to represent both
voiced and unvoiced "th" sounds (the sound at the beginning of
"the" is voiced; the sound at the end of "with" is unvoiced).</p>

<p>æ and Æ (ash): This letter, called "ash," may
be familiar to you from old-fashioned spellings of words like "Encyclopædia."
"Æ" in Old English is pronounced the same way as the "a"
in the words "bat" or "cat."</p>

<p>Below you will find some Modern English words with the
"th" sound replaced by "eth" or "thorn" and
some of the "a" sounds replaced with "ash."</p>

<ul>
	<li>Þat = that</li>
	<li>ðousand = thousand</li>
	<li>sixþ = sixth</li>
	<li>þin = thin</li>
	<li>wiðer = wither</li>
	<li>bæckground = background</li>
	<li>Æppetite= appetite</li>
	<li>Æt = at</li>
	<li>hæmmer = hammer</li>
</ul>

<p><b>English Prime</b> is a version of the English language that excludes all forms of the verb "to be", including all conjugations, contractions and archaic forms. Its goal is to leads to a less dogmatic style of language that reduces the possibility of misunderstanding or conflict.</p>

<p>Bourland sees specifically the "identity" and "predication" functions as pernicious, but advocates eliminating all forms for the sake of simplicity. In the case of the "existence" form (and less idiomatically, the "location" form), one might (for example) simply substitute the verb "exists". Other copula-substitutes in English include taste, feel, smell, sound, grow, remain, stay, and turn, among others a user of E-prime might use instead of "to be".</p>

<p>For example, instead of saying, "I am depressed," a student was asked to eliminate that emotionally primed verb and to say something else, such as, "I feel depressed when ..." or "I tend to make myself depressed about ..."</p>
