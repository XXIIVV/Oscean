<h2>Travel pictures from our sail from British Columbia.</h2>

<p>We sailed to Alaska, from Victoria, aboard <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a> in the
summer of 2024. We came up through Ketchikan, followed the inside passages
north to Petersburg, then west through Sitka, and back down south to <a
href='canada.html'>Prince Rupert</a>.</p>

Wild nights, Wild nights!
Were I with thee
Wild nights should be
Our luxury!

Futile, the winds
To a Heart in port
Done with the Compass
Done with the Chart!

Rowing in Eden
Ah, the Sea!
Might I but moor, tonight
In thee!
