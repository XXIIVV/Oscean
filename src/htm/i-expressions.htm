<h2>A tree representation typically represented with indentations.</h2>

<p>The syntax uses indentation to group expressions, and has no special cases for
semantic constructs of the language. It can be used both for program and data
input. It also allows mixing with <a
href='s-expressions.html'>S-expressions</a> freely, giving the programmer the
ability to layout the code as to maximize readability. </p>

<p>The s-exp <code>(* (+ 1 2) (/ 3 4))</code>, can be represented as the following i-exp:</p>

<pre>
*
 + 1 2
 / 3 4
</pre>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
define
   fac x
   if
    = x 0
    1
    * x
      fac
       - x 1
</pre>
