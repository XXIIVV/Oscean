<main><h2>Now lie in it.[DRAFT]</h2>

<p>Autumn is just around the corner and when the leaves begin to fall, it will have been four years since the <a href='devlog.html'>early sketches</a> of a personal computing system which became <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a>. I think it is interesting to look back and see what has happened since.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Uxn was designed explicitly to be a minimal bytecode target that would be capable of preserving a handful of <a href='https://100r.co/site/oquonie' target='_blank'>projects we had made</a>, and be flexible enough to accommodate for the ones we had yet to make, in a way that would be portable and robust <a href='https://100r.co/site/story.html' target='_blank'>against bitrot</a>.</p>

<p>In regard to preservation, more time is needed to know if it succeeded, but I can say that it has taken 3 years for the ISA to be frozen, and the tail end of that period saw changes <a href='https://lists.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn' target='_blank'>so subtle</a> as to not impact the projects made in the first two. The remaining work during that time was primarily about finding, documenting and testing against the remaining undefined behaviors.</p>

<p>During these four years, I have seen countless developers <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn' target='_blank'>successfully implement</a> the Varvara runtime from scratch without my help; this is giving me hope that for as long as the documentation survives, new runtimes can be created as the hardware platforms and operating systems change.</p>

<p>Uxn was indirectly meant to help us reconcile the power-hungry tools we used with the energy we were able to get from solar aboard our <a href='pino.html'>small boat</a>. It is a bit counter-intuitive and against what is commonly understood about virtual machines to go ahead knowing that it might just be too power intensive and self-defeating to target a virtual machine in which transformations are so granular that it would be hard for the host machine to optimize for.</p>

<p>It is only one part of a larger gesture toward reducing the strain on that one resource that involved more than just putting a virtual machine at the center of it all; what was possible to do on paper, outside the browser, or natively, was thereafter done that way, but still a few projects we had in mind were inextricably linked to portable graphical applications.</p>

<p>Uxn might have helped a bit but only so much; for instance the text-editor with which I am typing this article, and with which I do just about every <i>computery</i> things with, uses dramatically <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40805267' target='_blank'>less energy than what I used previously</a>. But I wouldn't attribute our extra power to the application running as a rom or not. I think where, as a target, it shines most brightly is in its helping me to reduce the cost of iterating during software development itself. For example if we compare the minuscule drain of assembling a rom in comparison to rebuilding a native graphical application or reloading a webapp.</p>

<q>It doesn't solve a real problem</q>

<p>I am not convinced that computers solve any real problems in the first place, the fact that asking a room full of software creators "<a href='https://forum.merveilles.town/thread/35/what-are-computers-for%2c-anyway%3f-39/' target='_blank'>what are computers for anyways?</a>" will get you little beyond vague suggestions of bureaucratic utility leaves me only asking, is bureaucracy solving any real problems, and so on, <i>ad absurdum</i>.</p>

<p>But if we are to put any value in preserving digital art, music, video games and other distractions from the very real problems that basic needs demand, it might be worthwhile to address the problem head-on and encourage piracy at a massive scale to duplicate digital content locally as to give digital data a fair chance to survive moving forward. Cloud platforms have all to loose by making us forget that we can utilize a specific length of bytes without their saying so, and emulation is but <a href='permacomputing.html'>one of many ways</a> of exploring this problem.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/turnipile.png' style="width:70%;margin: 0 auto 30px;display: block;"/>

<q>The problems it is trying to solve are self-inflicted</q>

<p>There is a time <a href='https://www.gypsy-traveller.org/policy-publications/' target='_blank'>immemorial tradition</a> of hating against the various flavors of nomadic vagabonds living in tents, cars, canal boats, and we are not exempt from that. The economics of living on the water without a permanent address seem to <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41136598' target='_blank'>elude most people</a> on discussion forums who believe that this way of life is something only the wealthy do, that everyone is in it by choice.</p>

<p>I don't think that our changing reality was what catalyzed my looking for alternatives, but it might have precipitated it. At that time, browsers hadn't started force-feeding AI toolbars, but it was already many years into Apple devising new ways to <a href='https://doctorow.medium.com/apple-fucked-us-on-right-to-repair-again-df4b35030480' target='_blank'>sabotage the repair of devices</a>; it was becoming obvious that my choice to target the modern web browser for my little graphical toys was a vote against decentralized general purpose computing, and one for the homogenization of computing by companies that were increasingly antagonistic to our situation.</p>

<p>Four years ago, had our situation been different, I don't know that I would have decided to stay with either iOS or web development. But even now, being more familiar with the landscape than I was, I am not sure that making use of pre-existing systems would have been viable solutions for what we were trying to do.</p>

<q>Too complicated, or not complicated enough</q>

<p>I noticed that Uxn attracts both esoteric and practical individuals. The esoteric crowd looking at the Uxn specification are rapid to point at <a href='https://dercuano.github.io/notes/uvc-archiving.html' target='_blank'>various alternatives</a> for which very few software exists, and the practical looking at the limitations tend to find all sorts of ways in which it is deficient, the memory is too small, the opcodes too few, the speed to slow.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I have seen people come around after looking back at the typical projects that they enjoy doing, and how they can be done comfortably with less means, but there is no denying that Uxn has a specific scope in mind and does not accommodate for all projects. That was never really its intended purpose, it has many times over been successful in, not acquiring users, but getting developers to explore their <a href='http://wastingmoves.com/laki.html' target='_blank'>own visions</a> and find joy there.</p>

<q>Was it all worth it?</q>

<p>Is it worth it to spend hundreds of hours to save what must amount to much, <i>much</i>, less? It depends, if you think too much about where you're going, you lose respect for where you are. I have friends who were complaining about a tool in 2020, lo and behold they still are today; their throughput would not be much improved had they spent a years detouring to rebuild a whole tech stack. For others, who see their ideals and tools diverge, it might be encouraging to see prior explorations in that space and I can tell you that I have absolutely no regrets in having spent the past 48 months making an environment that respects your values and idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>Four years ago, I also had my doubts that it would work out, but time flies when you're having fun!</p>
