<main><h2>Now lie in it.[DRAFT]</h2>

<p>Autumn is just around the corner and when the leaves begin to fall, it will have been four years since the <a href='devlog.html'>early sketches</a> of a personal computing system which became <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a>. I think it is interesting to look back and see what has happened since.</p>

<q>What problem is it supposed address?</q>
<p>Uxn was designed explicitly to be a minimal bytecode target that would be capable of preserving a handful of projects we had made, and be flexible enough to accommodate for the ones we had yet to make, in a way that is be portable and robust <a href='https://100r.co/site/story.html' target='_blank'>against bitrot</a>.</p>

<q>Does it work?</q>
<p>In regard to preservation, more time is needed to know if this succeeded, but I can say that it has taken 3 years for the Uxn core to be frozen, and the tail end of that period saw changes <a href='https://lists.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn' target='_blank'>so subtle</a> as to not impact the projects made in the first two. The remaining work during that time was primarily about finding, documenting and testing against the remaining undefined behaviors, of which Uxn has no longer any.</p>

<p>During these four years, I have seen countless developers <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn' target='_blank'>successfully implement</a> the Varvara runtime from scratch without my help; this is giving me hope that for as long as the documentation survives, new runtimes can be created as the hardware platforms and operating systems change.</p>

<q>Is it a real problem?</q>
<p>I am not the least convinced that computers solve any real problems in the first place, the fact that asking a room full of software creators "what are computers for?" will get you little beyond vague suggestions of bureaucratic utility leaves me only asking, is bureaucracy solving any real problems, and so on, <i>ad absurdum</i>.</p>

<p>But if we are to put any value in preserving digital art, music, video games and other distractions from that very real problems that basic needs demand, it might be worth our while to address the problem head on and encourage piracy at a massive scale to duplicate digital content locally as to give this digital data a fair chance to survive moving forward, because cloud platforms have all to loose by making us forget that we can utilize a specific length of bytes without their saying so.</p>

<q>Uxn is too complicated</q>
<p>I noticed that Uxn attracts various sorts of individuals, from the esoteric to the practical. The esoteric crowd looking at the Uxn specification think "this is much too complicated, see we have brainfuck here". It's a fair comment, as bf enjoyer myself, I can see how this strays from the tarpit, but again look around and notice how very few drawing tools, video games and music trackers are written in bf.</p>

<q>Uxn is not complicated enough</q>
<p>The practical crowd looking at the Uxn limitations tend to find all sorts of ways in which it is deficient, the memory is too small, the opcodes too few, the speed to slow. I can see that some people eventually come around, especially once they look back at the typical projects that they do, and how they can be done comfortably with less space, simpler languages and more efficiently, but there is no denying that Uxn has a specific scope in mind and does not easily accommodate for certain flavors of convenience.</p>

<q>Something, something, solar power</q>
<p>Against what is commonly understood of these kinds of virtual machines, I went ahead with the idea knowingly that it might just be too power intensive and self-defeating to target a virtual machine in which transformations are so granular that it would be hard for the host machine to optimize for. Uxn was indirectly meant to help us reconcile the power-hungry tools we used with the energy we were able to get from solar aboard our small boat.</p>

<p>It was part of a larger gesture toward reducing the strain on that one resource that involved more than just putting a virtual machine at the center of it all; what was possible to do on paper, outside the browser, or natively, was thereafter done that way, but still a few projects we had in mind were inextricably linked to portable graphical applications and so we decided to address that in this way.</p>

<p>Uxn might have helped a bit but only so much; for instance the text-editor with which I am typing this article, and with which I do just about all computery things with, uses dramatically less energy than what I used previously. But I wouldn't attribute our extra power to the application running as a uxn program or not. I think where Uxn, as a target, shines most brightly is in its helping to reduce the cost of iterating during software development itself. For example if we compare the minuscule drain of reassembling a rom in comparison to rebuilding a native application or reloading a webapp.</p>


<q>Again, is it a real problem?</q>

<h3>Other paths</h3>

<p>Four years ago, had our situation been different, I don't know that I would have decided to stick with iOS development, nor web development. I don't think that our changing reality was what catalyzed my looking for alternatives, but it might have precipitated it. At that time, browsers hadn't started forcing AI toolchains in, but it was already many years into Apple's battle against the right to repair their devices and Adobe's clawing at my wallet; it was already becoming apparent that someone's deliberate choice to target the modern web browser for their little graphical toys was a vote against decentralized general purpose computing, and one for the homogenization of computing and monetization of my attention by handful companies which were already antagonistic at the time. Everything is political.</p>

<p>But I did discover interesting things along the way.. If I had to do it different, I would-</p>
