	<h2>2024-07-12 Southward</h2>
	<p>We twice waved farewell to Sitka. A few hours after untying the lines, the
engine that normally cycles water through itself to cool down decided that it
would not do that anymore. The problem appeared to have gone away after some
thinkering, only to return further down the coast, precipitating an emergency
arrival in some questionably-sheltered flies-infested inlet hidden past a few
jagged rocks that the ocean breakers still have unsuccesfully softened. We
dropped the anchor, slept, slept some more, once our strength returned, we
had to seriously take things apart and <a href='action.html#fun'>figure shit out</a>.</p>
	<p>For as long as Uxn has been around, I've meant to resume and complete a puzzle
game that Rek and I wanted to build after <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a>,
called <a href='markl.html'>Markl</a>. During these recent night passages I've
spent my watches playing the game out in my head, and arrived to an exciting
place with the design. I've started implemented it the moment we reached a
port.</p>

	<h2>2024-06-25 A sensibility for the useless</h2>
	<p>We have sailed as far north as we are willing to go this year. As the summer
weather settles, heading further would mean crossing longer distances with
decreasing chances of favorable winds, less sailing and more motoring, which
does not appeal to us one bit. We'll head to <a
href='alaska.html'>Sitka</a> before making our way back down to <a
href='canada.html'>warmer waters</a> and enjoy what remains of the summer free
of foul-weather jackets.</p>
	<p>Spend enough time in the esoteric programming circuit and you'll come across
the usual suspects: self-generating programs, polyglot programs and quines; but
until this week I had never heard of ambigram/palindrome programs, which that
can be evaluated from either directions. Naturally, I had to have a go at it,
and I've added it to my growing collection of <a href='uxntal_labyrinth.html'>
labyrintine programs</a>.</p>

	<h2>2024-06-14 Endless summer days</h2>
	<p>Alaskan summer days are long, the sun wakes us up at 4am, and it stays bright
until 11pm. By 5am, the batteries are already topped up from solar, if we were
very motivated, we could solar-cook every meals each day.</p>
	<p>I occupy the few moments we have between sails by knocking down tasks I had in
my notes for a while, like making a <a
href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn-utils/tree/main/item/cli/uxndis'
target='_blank'>disassembler</a> and cleaning up the <a
href='https://rabbits.srht.site/uxn5/' target='_blank'>web emulator</a> enough
that I can use it to show programs on wiki pages, like <a

	<p>Sitting aboard Pino in the <a href='https://100r.co/site/prince_rupert.html'
target='_blank'>last port in Canada</a> before entering <a href='alaska.html'>Alaska</a>, thinking about
how odd it is to be sailing straight from the south and having to change
timezone. We've been moving every day of the past two weeks, making use of the
favorable wind to jump from anchorage to anchorage. During these long passages,
I try to write the talk for <a href='talk.html'>Handmade</a> in my head.</p>
	<p>Abner, who organizes the conference, asked me specifically to explore <a
href='solarpunk.html'>other ways to live</a> with the attending creatives and
developers affected by burnout or the mass layoffs. I've had Edna St. Vincent
Millay's poem in mind these past few weeks, it goes: </p>

	<p>We've stowed away our 120v devices, untied the lines and begun our sail north
to <a href='alaska.html'>Alaska</a>! During the next few days, we will sail
through the inside passage and out the northern tip of Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>As we hop between anchorages, I'd like to try exploring the question: Is a
<a href='thuesday.html'>graphical environment</a> running on top a naive <a

	<h2>2024-04-13 String rewrite II</h2>
	<p>Rek and I are completing the remaining projects on our pre-departure list and
provisioning for our sail to <a href='alaska.html'>Alaska</a>. Over the winter,
we've strengthened critical parts aboard <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>, replaced
experienced pieces of the rigging and simplified the habitat's life-systems
&mdash; Hopefully, this will all make the journey safer, and dryer.</p>
	<p>After exploring Wryl's <a href='modal.html'>Modal language</a> further, I
decided to write <a href='../etc/modal.c.txt' target='_blank'>an
implementation</a> to better understand how it worked, mechanically. This
sparked a renewed interest from the original creator, attracted members of
catlang community to explore string rewriting and has given me long and
delightful evenings pondering about how to crack various programming problems
with it. </p>

	<h2>2024-04-02 String rewrite I</h2>
	<p>We are waiting for a few parts that we had machined, to return to us from the local fabricator. While we wait, I spend most of time playing with esolangs, one that has especially interested me lately is <a href='modal.html'>Modal</a>, which is a simple string-rewriting scheme similar to <a href='thue'>Thue</a>, but with the added feature that it allows for variables, and recognizes scope delimiters. It's a brutally simple idea that allows a program to be shaped as to mimic nearly any programing paradigm.</p>
	<p>I had been reticent to expanding the <a href='uxntal_macros.html'>Uxntal macro</a> system because of how it creates disjointed fragments of code that couldn't be properly optimized, but after talking to people writing programs in which macros were definitely the right tool for the task, I've decided to rewrite the implementation and make them more robust. </p>

	<h2>2024-03-21 Catlangs</h2>
	<p>As days are getting warmer, we can begin to tackle some much needed
maintenance topside like changing old lines, revarnishing the oars and
inspecting the rigging. After a whole winter of getting up in the dark to do
weight training, I feel it was well worth it as my back pain is
gone, I sleep better and feel more overall physically capable. I have a month
left of gym membership and plan to make use of it as much as I physically can
before its expiration, and our casting off.</p>
	<p>I've spend the idle hours of these past few days improving <a
href='left.html'>Left</a>, thinking about <a
href='concatenative.html'>concatenative programming</a> and trying to better
understand <a
href='https://concatenative.yahoogroups.narkive.com/hrdFdrU7/stack-what-does-actually-mean'
target='_blank'>what makes a language concatenative</a>. To try and answer this
question, I've asked members of the catlang community to add example programs
for the various flavors. One of these examples was the <a
href='https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Tak%20function' target='_blank'>Tak
Function</a> which was new to me, and found it to map surprisingly well to
stack programming.</p>

	<h2>2024-03-10 Left revamp</h2>
	<p>We took <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>'s chainplates off and while the new ones
are being fabricated, we reinforced the area where the chainplate meet the
deck. It makes for a momentarily uninhabitable place to live, so I haven't had
much headspace to do creative work these past few days, but it will be well
worth it considering the places we're hoping to venture into.</p>
	<p>Whenever I get to reclaim my desk from the pile of tools and materials that
took residency on there, I fool around with <a href='utf8.html'>UTF-8</a>
encoding support in <a href='left.html'>Left</a>. Looking into how diacritics
can be appended to other glyphs, I've begun to consider if I couldn't possibly
encode the <a href='uxntal_alphabet.html'>Uxntal Alphabet</a> entirely from
pre-existing glyphs within the two-bytes range and use diacritics for
modes.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Made a few improvements to <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/left' target='_blank'>Left</a>'s support for UTF-8.</li>

	<h2>2024-02-25 Hello, Dot?</h2>
	<p>Our plans for the summer are coming into focus. It looks like we'll depart
early, head as far north as we can make it, and see if the boat and its crew
can weather the cold. This ought to give us taste of what we might expect would
we decide to make it further into the arctic next year.</p>
	<p>Someone found an interesting undefined behavior in the assembly of Uxn code,
where the <a href='uxntal_scope.html'>nesting of child labels</a> could be
implemented in one of two ways, leading to an incompatiblity between
assemblers. I've explored this further and found myself pulled me into a
concatenative object-oriented programming rabbit-hole.</p>

once I had done so, I kept pushing further and became obsessed with this

	<p>The forge that we use at Hundred Rabbits has been <a
href='https://status.sr.ht' target='_blank'>taken down by DDoS attacks</a> and
is struggling to come back online, the event reminded us that we ought to also
have mirrors and release versions of these source files available elsewhere. I've begun
to host copies across our various websites. The builds are still
accessible through <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io'
target='_blank'>itch.io</a>.</p>
	<p>Until we regain access and release the changes of the last few days, keeping
with the spirit of improving the resilience of the tools we use I've taken a
moment to write a kind of <i>pocket version</i> of the console emulator and <a
href='drifblim.html'>self-hosted assembler</a> as to see how many lines are
needed to start from the seed assembler and replicate it. A copy of the pocket
emulator, the source for the assembler and its hexadecimal representation have
been <a href='uxn.html'>added to the wiki</a>.</p>
