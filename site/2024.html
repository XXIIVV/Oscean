	<p>We are again in familiar waters, with their familiar weather radio voices,
tugboats, madronas, lean little swallows, cormorants, banana slugs and
extremely bitter IPAs. We wake up and it's still dark out, summer must be
slipping away; the sun looks all burnt up, red and angry against the morning
haze. The music aboard is changing to an appropriate shoegaze, as if to match
the rustling of leaves and wailing of the wind passing through the shrouds.</p>
	<p>Six or seven months has been enough to fall so far behind software updates, to
miss just enough versions, that even the part of the program that looks for
updates doesn't recognize the new server endpoints. As expected, most updated
things got worse, a few of them became <a

target='_blank'>quite awful</a>, as it typically goes with software. A friend
uses <i>necrotic</i> as opposed to bitrot, because bitrot implies things have
been left to decay but software necrosis is rotting while being alive and
maintained.</p>

our legs remember how to walk, where are the fair weather clothes, put away the

	<p>The automated weather radio voice drones about the advent of favorable
northerly winds that never manifest, so we've resorted to doing short hops,
weather permitting, between the safety of one inlet and the next whenever the
storm catches its breath, often against tide, oftener against wind. We occupy
the disquieting lulls of what feels more like trench warfare than passaging
drowned in tea, blankets and the <a href='reading.html'>smell of paperbacks</a>.</p>

	<p>The inlets we find ourselves anchored in are worlds of their own with
inhabitants that, as transitory as some may be, are affairing themselves with
happenings that extend to the shores of the lagoon, but no further. A
strange new thing has come into the sheltered water and disrupted its hubbub,
now everyone looks as if caught in a gasp, at its skyward pointing wing, at its
opaque lifelessness. Through the oblong eyes of the vessel, like under a
diving bell, we peer back in wonder.</p>
	<p>There are as many days to our bow without connectivity than those that lay
between our stern and Prince Rupert, where we were last able to make contact.
In these secluded days, I am reminded of a passage from one of Thoreau's
journals that reads the inscription on a Swedish inn: </p>

	<p>We twice waved farewell to Sitka. A few hours after untying the lines, the
engine that normally cycles water through itself to cool down decided that it
would not do that anymore. The problem appeared to have gone away after some
tinkering, only to return further down the coast, precipitating an emergency
arrival in some questionably-sheltered flies-infested inlet hidden past but a
few jagged rocks that the ocean breakers have as of yet unsuccessfully softened.
We dropped the anchor, slept, slept some more, once our strength returned, we
had to seriously take things apart and <a href='action.html#fun'>figure shit

	<h2>2024-06-25 A sensibility for the useless</h2>
	<p>We have sailed as far north as we are willing to go this year. As the summer
weather settles, heading further would mean crossing longer distances with
decreasing chances of favorable winds, less sailing and more motoring, which
does not appeal to us one bit. We'll head to <a

href='canada.html'>warmer waters</a> and enjoy what remains of the summer free
of foul-weather jackets.</p>
	<p>Spend enough time in the esoteric programming circuit and you'll come across
the usual suspects: self-generating programs, polyglot programs and quines; but
until this week I had never heard of ambigram/palindrome programs, which that
can be evaluated from either directions. Naturally, I had to have a go at it,

decided to write <a href='../etc/modal.c.txt' target='_blank'>an

It's a brutally simple idea that allows a program to be shaped as to mimic nearly any programing paradigm.</p>
	<p>I had been reticent to expanding the <a href='uxntal_macros.html'>Uxntal macro</a> system because of how it creates disjointed fragments of code that couldn't be properly optimized, but after talking to people writing programs in which macros were definitely the right tool for the task, I've decided to rewrite the implementation and make them more robust. </p>

	<p>The forge that we use at Hundred Rabbits has been <a
href='https://status.sr.ht' target='_blank'>taken down by DDoS attacks</a> and
is struggling to come back online, the event reminded us that we ought to also
have mirrors and release versions of these source files available elsewhere. I've begun
to host copies across our various websites. The builds are still
accessible through <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io'
target='_blank'>itch.io</a>.</p>
	<p>Until we regain access and release the changes of the last few days, keeping
with the spirit of improving the resilience of the tools we use I've taken a
moment to write a kind of <i>pocket version</i> of the console emulator and <a
href='drifblim.html'>self-hosted assembler</a> as to see how many lines are
needed to start from the seed assembler and replicate it. A copy of the pocket
emulator, the source for the assembler and its hexadecimal representation have
been <a href='uxn.html'>added to the wiki</a>.</p>
	<p>In the meantime, if anyone is looking for a specific file that is currently
unavailable, get in touch!</p>
