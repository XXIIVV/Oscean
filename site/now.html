	<p></p>
	<p>Back from Seattle, where I had the immense pleasure of sharing a few days
with kind, passionate and most of all <a href='merveilles.html'>wonderful</a> individuals, some I had
crossed paths with already, others, new faces that I am now looking forward
to see once more. Evenings were busied with conversations that felt as easy as
picking up where we might have left off despite not having seen each other for
years, or even when meeting for the first time.</p>
	<p>I was curious to see whether using creative storytelling to give a <a href='talk.html'>talk</a> about
computation would resonate with the Handmade attendees, fortunately, that based
on what echoed late into the night within the halls of the Mediterannean Inn,
above tables covered with <a href='zines.html'>zines</a> and whiteboards ornate with hastily scribbled
<a href='rewriting.html'>rewrite rules</a>, most people <i>got</i> it. I hope that my loveletter to the work
of Borges, Conway and Wryl, will be an invitation to explore the space of
rewriting, while remaining critical of the trajectory of computing.</p>

	<p>October came and went, ideas piled up in notebooks, but I kept on drawing. I
knew already by the time I had finished the <a
href='pocket_rewriting.html'>Pocket Rewriting</a> zine that I would make a
dynamic implementation of it which, by the way, was very well received despite
my not having even had a chance of giving away a single one. I was delighted to
see folks print their own copies.</p>
	<p>These past two weeks have been a throwback to the release of <a
href='orca.html'>Orca</a>, where the less <i>programmatically inclined</i>
started playing with it right away, and those with preconceptions about what
programming is, what it should look and work like, found it inscrutable and
opaque. To some, the booklet remains near undecipherable. I will try to help
bridge that gap with more approachable documentation and examples over the winter.</p>

	<p>Three weeks! I think that was the longest I went on without writing a single
line of code for the past many years, for even during long transits at sea, I
find time to sneak some in to answer these questions one ponders while gazing
at the horizon. I had other things on my mind this month, slides to finish,
dailies to draw, and settling back in our winter life in Victoria. As of
yesterday, that streak ended.</p>
	<p>For the upcoming <a href='https://handmadecities.com/seattle/'
target='_blank'>Handmade event</a>, I wanted to be able to show anyone who
might ask a few simple examples of rewriting computation in a way that would
not be intrusive during a conversation, so I printed a <a
href='zines.html'>zine</a> that covers the basics of it, basics that I could
foresee myself repeat over again and having a challenging time doing so without
visual aids, rewriting being inherently a visual coding paradigm.</p>

	<p>I finished my slides but I left in them some gaps to fill with puns, and
other miscellanea. There's this one where a whole culture of people is
programming entirely by <a href='fractran.html'>multiplying fractions</a>,
y'know what would be ridiculous? If I had actual examples, or even
implementations of classic functions to show the attendees. Not only that, how
better would my point be made if I built enough documentation to teach people
and even wrote games for it. </p>
	<p>It has been 4 weeks now, I have vivid dreams in which I reduce the number of
steps it takes my fractions to find the Fibonacci sequence, I have written 3
different implementations and sit on enough material for a
whole extra talk of its own, or at least enough to bore a whole amphitheater to
tears. &mdash; Have we lost the plot yet?</p>

the rustling of leaves and wailing of the wind passing through the shrouds.</p>
	<p>Six or seven months has been enough to fall so far behind software updates, to
miss just enough versions, that even the part of the program that looks for

	<p>The automated weather radio voice drones about the advent of favorable
northerly winds that never manifest, so we've resorted to doing short hops,
weather permitting, between the safety of one inlet and the next whenever the
storm catches its breath, often against tide, oftener against wind. We occupy
the disquieting lulls of what feels more like trench warfare than passaging
drowned in tea, blankets and the <a href='reading.html'>smell of paperbacks</a>.</p>

	<p>The inlets we find ourselves anchored in are worlds of their own with
inhabitants that, as transitory as some may be, are affairing themselves with
happenings that extend to the shores of the lagoon, but no further. A
strange new thing has come into the sheltered water and disrupted its hubbub,
now everyone looks as if caught in a gasp, at its skyward pointing wing, at its
opaque lifelessness. Through the oblong eyes of the vessel, like under a
diving bell, we peer back in wonder.</p>
	<p>There are as many days to our bow without connectivity than those that lay
between our stern and Prince Rupert, where we were last able to make contact.
In these secluded days, I am reminded of a passage from one of Thoreau's

	<p>We twice waved farewell to Sitka. A few hours after untying the lines, the
engine that normally cycles water through itself to cool down decided that it
would not do that anymore. The problem appeared to have gone away after some
tinkering, only to return further down the coast, precipitating an emergency
arrival in some questionably-sheltered flies-infested inlet hidden past but a
few jagged rocks that the ocean breakers have as of yet unsuccessfully softened.
We dropped the anchor, slept, slept some more, once our strength returned, we

	<p>We have sailed as far north as we are willing to go this year. As the summer

decreasing chances of favorable winds, less sailing and more motoring, which
does not appeal to us one bit. We'll head to <a

the usual suspects: self-generating programs, polyglot programs and quines; but

	<h2>2024-03-21 Catlangs</h2>
	<p>As days are getting warmer, we can begin to tackle some much needed
maintenance topside like changing old lines, varnishing the oars and inspecting
the rigging. After a whole winter of getting up in the dark to do weight
training, I feel it was well worth it as my back pain is gone, I sleep better
and feel more overall physically capable. I have a month left of gym membership
and plan to make use of it as much as I physically can before its expiration,
and our casting off.</p>
	<p>I've spend the idle hours of these past few days improving <a
href='left.html'>Left</a>, thinking about <a
href='concatenative.html'>concatenative programming</a> and trying to better
understand <a
href='https://concatenative.yahoogroups.narkive.com/hrdFdrU7/stack-what-does-actually-mean'
target='_blank'>what makes a language concatenative</a>. To try and answer this
question, I've asked members of the catlang community to add example programs
for the various flavors. One of these examples was the <a
href='https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Tak%20function' target='_blank'>Tak
Function</a> which was new to me, and found it to map surprisingly well to
stack programming.</p>

<h2>2023</h2>

<p>It's funny how I can go from being utterly terrified at the onset of a
project such as the <a href='https://100r.co/site/electrical_refit.html'
target='_blank'>total rewiring</a> of <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>, to looking
back thinking that it wasn't at all as hard as you expected, and having that
familiar realization that that twinge of fear is more often about
<i>starting</i> than it is about doing the task itself. </p>

<p>As a little gift to ourselves, Rek and I ported <a
href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> to <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>, which
somewhat ensures that this little world to remains playable now that the
previous builds have begun to have mixed success running on recent operating
systems.</p>

<img loading='lazy' src='../media/diary/816.jpg'/>

<p>Rek and I were invited to do a residency at LEÑA, and we sailed to our dream
destination, the breath-taking <a
href="https://100r.co/site/princess_louisa_inlet.html" target="_blank">Princess
Louisa Inlet</a>. I had, once again, the opportunity of crossing the US by
train, eastward this time, with a bunch of amazing people heading to the last
of the <a href='https://100r.co/site/computing_and_sustainability.html'
target='_blank'>Strange Loop</a> conferences. I got a tattoo of my favourite
demon, Stolas, by my friend and favourite tattoo artist <a
href='https://ritualdust.com/tattoo/' target='_blank'>Lizbeth</a>. </p>

<p>After a short fling with <a href='parallel_computing.html'>parallel
computing</a>, I realized that it was more trouble than it was worth for the
scale of projects that interested me. I've added lambdas to Uxntal, which was
certainly the single greatest UX improvement to the language since its
creation.</p>

<p>This crazy and wonder-full year ended with the publication of Rek's latest
novel <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a>, and as the year and projects come
to an end, we are now turning our gaze back to the horizon for the next year,
and our next projects.</p>

<p>For the year of 2023, Maurice Renard's Le Peril Bleu, was my favourite <a
href='reading.html'>book</a>. Coline Serreau's La Belle Verte was my favourite <a
href='watching.html'>movie</a>. Cimerion's Contresort was my favourite <a

	<h2>2023-09-25 Strange Loop Or Die Tryin'</h2>
	<p>On the eve of the talk, I sit half-awake waiting for my first real meal since
leaving Victoria to arrive, it's been two hours, blatter is coming down hard on
this very loud, and very understaffed, and only available vegetarian place
within walking farness from the hotel. And, my voice is shut, the talk is in a
few hours.</p>

<p>I normally am a really careful planner when it comes to giving these sorts of
technical talks, you wouldn't catch me going out the night before.</p>

<p>I had assumed that the train from Seattle would either carry their one
vegetarian meal on the menu, or accommodate. After a first day of eating cold
bread loaves with margarine, and an altercation with an uncompromising
attendant on the second day, I managed to secure myself a "<i>Steamed Russet
Potato A-la Tomato Sauce</i>" for the third.</p>

<p>I had also assumed that the venue would carry palatable vegan options, or that
I could cook my own. After missing the Strange Loop meal service twice in a
row, due to talk scheduling conflicts, I managed to queue long enough to
acquire one of the last remaining scoops of an awful vegan soup. I promptly
returned to stealing whole fruits from the hotel gym and eating them in my
room, which I was content with. The problem that wasn't apparent at first was
that eating sweets all day kept me up all night. </p>

<p>Despite these mistakes in preparing properly for the road leading to the talk,
I managed to show up on stage on time, give an (hopefully) entertaining
presentation at Strange Loop 2023. I'd love to give a sunderly thank to Jack
Rusher for the tea that brought my voice back, and Josh Morrow for letting me
borrow their laptop and install Uxn on it for the presentation.</p>

	<p>I've done little else this week other than proof-reading Rek's <a

working on program verification, that I might like to realize in the fall. A
system like <a href='smalltalk.html'>Smalltalk</a>'s definition of interfaces
for message passing, in which a message must find a match in the listening
object's methods dictionary, might help improve Uxntal's expressiveness and be
realized entirely with syntax already understood by the assembler.</p>

	<p>We're on our way north, anchored in Telegraph harbor. We've preserved enough
food to get us through the summer, and stocked the shelves with <a

finding a copy of Carroll's <i>Sylvie & Bruno</i>, and Golding's <i>Lord Of The

	<p>To continue my research on concatenative language inference, in contrast to
the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnrea' target='_blank'>reassembler</a>
which creates an intelligible textual representation from a binary file and a

works from a textual source file and reindents it based on context. An
interesting puzzle, considering how few syntaxic structures Uxntal has, lacking

different patterns.</p>

	<h2>2023-05-01 Concurrency All The Things</h2>
	<p>I recently watched David Ungar's <i>Everything You Know About Parallel
Programming Is Wrong</i> talk, which lead me to read Tony Hoare's
<i>Communicating Sequential Processes</i>, after which I felt inspired to
consider <a href='parallel_computing.html'>parallel computing</a> once more,
and soon found myself taking a detour to play with the <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam_(programming_language)'
target='_blank'>OCCAM programming language</a>, and revisit threads in Uxn.</p>
	<p>As a side-project, unrelated to threads, I made a pixel-perfect
implementation of the classic Macintosh Note Pad application, so I could keep
notes throughout the day and that turned out to be a fantastic aid to
collecting passing thoughts. While building it, I also had a chance to
implement text-wrapping in a project with very few moving parts and better
understood how to handle text selection, where the boundary of a selection ends
up being before the original anchor, and implemented it in <a

	<h2>2023-04-22 Structured Editing</h2>
	<p>These past few months, I've explored <a href='computation.html'>playful
things</a> to do with programming that might not directly serve a purpose, or
at least, one wouldn't come across them without seeking them out specifically,
and I've collected some of those seemingly useless, ideas into a talk and
submitted it to the <a href='https://www.thestrangeloop.com'
target='_blank'>Strange Loop</a> conference happening in September.</p>
	<p>Also, while I consider <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a> to be a kind of
<i>disassembler</i>, I wanted to see if I could build something that would let
me go from a source file to an assembled rom, and back again. I figured that
being able to recover a project from a rom and its symbols file has important
potential in terms of data preservation. To make this possible, I modified the
<a href='symbols.html'>symbols file</a> to include comments, and was able to
complete the back and forth I wanted.</p>
