	<p>We are again in familiar waters, with their familiar weather radio voices,
tugboats, madronas, lean little swallows, cormorants, banana slugs and
extremely bitter IPAs. We wake up and it's still dark out, summer must be
slipping away; the sun looks all burnt up, red and angry against the morning
haze. The music aboard is changing to an appropriate shoegaze, as if to match
the rustling of leaves and wailing of the wind passing through the shrouds.</p>
	<p>Six or seven months has been enough to fall so far behind software updates, to
miss just enough versions, that even the part of the program that looks for
updates doesn't recognize the new server endpoints. As expected, most updated
things got worse, a few of them became <a

	<p>The automated weather radio voice drones about the advent of favorable
northerly winds that never manifest, so we've resorted to doing short hops,
weather permitting, between the safety of one inlet and the next whenever the
storm catches its breath, often against tide, oftener against wind. We occupy
the disquieting lulls of what feels more like trench warfare than passaging
drowned in tea, blankets and the <a href='reading.html'>smell of paperbacks</a>.</p>

	<p>The inlets we find ourselves anchored in are worlds of their own with
inhabitants that, as transitory as some may be, are affairing themselves with
happenings that extend to the shores of the lagoon, but no further. A
strange new thing has come into the sheltered water and disrupted its hubbub,
now everyone looks as if caught in a gasp, at its skyward pointing wing, at its
opaque lifelessness. Through the oblong eyes of the vessel, like under a
diving bell, we peer back in wonder.</p>
	<p>There are as many days to our bow without connectivity than those that lay
between our stern and Prince Rupert, where we were last able to make contact.
In these secluded days, I am reminded of a passage from one of Thoreau's

	<p>We twice waved farewell to Sitka. A few hours after untying the lines, the
engine that normally cycles water through itself to cool down decided that it
would not do that anymore. The problem appeared to have gone away after some
tinkering, only to return further down the coast, precipitating an emergency
arrival in some questionably-sheltered flies-infested inlet hidden past but a
few jagged rocks that the ocean breakers have as of yet unsuccessfully softened.
We dropped the anchor, slept, slept some more, once our strength returned, we
had to seriously take things apart and <a href='action.html#fun'>figure shit

	<p>We have sailed as far north as we are willing to go this year. As the summer
weather settles, heading further would mean crossing longer distances with
decreasing chances of favorable winds, less sailing and more motoring, which
does not appeal to us one bit. We'll head to <a

of foul-weather jackets.</p>
	<p>Spend enough time in the esoteric programming circuit and you'll come across
the usual suspects: self-generating programs, polyglot programs and quines; but
until this week I had never heard of ambigram/palindrome programs, which that

	<h2>2024-01-26 Back to music</h2>
	<p>I've originally started looking into virtual machines to build a target to
host some games, a handful of tools and my wiki &mdash; but instead of stopping
once I had done so, I kept pushing further and became obsessed with this
programming language design stuff, and along the way, I lost track of why I was
even doing it all in the first place. After a two year detour, I look back and
I've almost totally ignored my other interests as a digital artist and
musician. It's about time I find my way back. </p>

	<p>The forge that we use at Hundred Rabbits has been <a

is struggling to come back online, the event reminded us that we ought to also
have mirrors and release versions of these source files available elsewhere. I've begun
to host copies across our various websites. The builds are still
accessible through <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io'

	<p>Until we regain access and release the changes of the last few days, keeping
with the spirit of improving the resilience of the tools we use I've taken a
moment to write a kind of <i>pocket version</i> of the console emulator and <a

needed to start from the seed assembler and replicate it. A copy of the pocket
emulator, the source for the assembler and its hexadecimal representation have

<h2>2023</h2>

<p>It's funny how I can go from being utterly terrified at the onset of a
project such as the <a href='https://100r.co/site/electrical_refit.html'
target='_blank'>total rewiring</a> of <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>, to looking
back thinking that it wasn't at all as hard as you expected, and having that
familiar realization that that twinge of fear is more often about
<i>starting</i> than it is about doing the task itself. </p>

<p>As a little gift to ourselves, Rek and I ported <a
href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> to <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>, which
somewhat ensures that this little world to remains playable now that the
previous builds have begun to have mixed success running on recent operating
systems.</p>

<img loading='lazy' src='../media/diary/816.jpg'/>

<p>Rek and I were invited to do a residency at LEÑA, and we sailed to our dream
destination, the breath-taking <a
href="https://100r.co/site/princess_louisa_inlet.html" target="_blank">Princess
Louisa Inlet</a>. I had, once again, the opportunity of crossing the US by
train, eastward this time, with a bunch of amazing people heading to the last
of the <a href='https://100r.co/site/computing_and_sustainability.html'
target='_blank'>Strange Loop</a> conferences. I got a tattoo of my favourite
demon, Stolas, by my friend and favourite tattoo artist <a
href='https://ritualdust.com/tattoo/' target='_blank'>Lizbeth</a>. </p>

<p>After a short fling with <a href='parallel_computing.html'>parallel
computing</a>, I realized that it was more trouble than it was worth for the
scale of projects that interested me. I've added lambdas to Uxntal, which was
certainly the single greatest UX improvement to the language since its
creation.</p>

<p>This crazy and wonder-full year ended with the publication of Rek's latest
novel <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a>, and as the year and projects come
to an end, we are now turning our gaze back to the horizon for the next year,
and our next projects.</p>

<p>For the year of 2023, Maurice Renard's Le Peril Bleu, was my favourite <a
href='reading.html'>book</a>. Coline Serreau's La Belle Verte was my favourite <a
href='watching.html'>movie</a>. Cimerion's Contresort was my favourite <a
href='listening.html'>album</a>. </p>

	<p>I've been taking it easy for the last few days of the year, cooked a lot,

exploring low-level symbolic computing, but who knows where these things might

	<h2>2023-09-25 Strange Loop Or Die Tryin'</h2>
	<p>On the eve of the talk, I sit half-awake waiting for my first real meal since
leaving Victoria to arrive, it's been two hours, blatter is coming down hard on
this very loud, and very understaffed, and only available vegetarian place
within walking distance from the hotel. And, my voice is shut, the talk is in a
few hours.</p>

<p>I normally am a really careful planner when it comes to giving these sorts of
technical talks, you wouldn't catch me going out the night before.</p>

<p>I had assumed that the train from Seattle would either carry their one
vegetarian meal on the menu, or accommodate. After a first day of eating cold
bread loaves with margarine, and an altercation with an uncompromising
attendant on the second day, I managed to secure myself a "<i>Steamed Russet
Potato A-la Tomato Sauce</i>" for the third.</p>

<p>I had also assumed that the venue would carry palatable vegan options, or that
I could cook my own. After missing the Strange Loop meal service twice in a
row, due to talk scheduling conflicts, I managed to queue long enough to
acquire one of the last remaining scoops of an awful vegan soup. I promptly
returned to stealing whole fruits from the hotel gym and eating them in my
room, which I was content with. The problem that wasn't apparent at first was
that eating sweets all day kept me up all night. </p>

<p>Despite these mistakes in preparing properly for the road leading to the talk,
I managed to show up on stage on time, give an (hopefully) entertaining
presentation at Strange Loop 2023. I'd love to give a special thank to Jack
Rusher for the tea that brought my voice back, and Josh Morrow for letting me
borrow their laptop and install Uxn on it for the presentation.</p>

	<p>Not previously knowing the language, I have spent the past few days neck-deep

how many single-purpose labels were used merely to hop over short lengths of

walked up and down the old trails to our heart's content, maybe we'll keep

	<h2>2023-05-12 Type Inference</h2>
	<p>For a few weeks now, I've been sketching the basis for a <a

across a stack-effect validator when writing <a
href='https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-inference.html'

reading Rob Kleffner's <a
href='https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/blog/static/stack-languages-talk-notes.pdf'
target='_blank'>talk notes</a>. Prior to this project, I had a sense of what
the different constructions were, but writing a <a

different patterns.</p>
	<p>We're casting off for <a href='https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html'

	<h2>2023-05-01 Concurrency All The Things</h2>
	<p>I recently watched David Ungar's <i>Everything You Know About Parallel
Programming Is Wrong</i> talk, which lead me to read Tony Hoare's
<i>Communicating Sequential Processes</i>, after which I felt inspired to
consider <a href='parallel_computing.html'>parallel computing</a> once more,
and soon found myself taking a detour to play with the <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam_(programming_language)'
target='_blank'>OCCAM programming language</a>, and revisit threads in Uxn.</p>
	<p>As a side-project, unrelated to threads, I made a pixel-perfect
implementation of the classic Macintosh Note Pad application, so I could keep
notes throughout the day and that turned out to be a fantastic aid to
collecting passing thoughts. While building it, I also had a chance to
implement text-wrapping in a project with very few moving parts and better
understood how to handle text selection, where the boundary of a selection ends
up being before the original anchor, and implemented it in <a

	<p>These past few months, I've explored <a href='computation.html'>playful
things</a> to do with programming that might not directly serve a purpose, or
at least, one wouldn't come across them without seeking them out specifically,
and I've collected some of those seemingly useless, ideas into a talk and

target='_blank'>Strange Loop</a> conference happening in September.</p>
	<p>Also, while I consider <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a> to be a kind of
<i>disassembler</i>, I wanted to see if I could build something that would let
me go from a source file to an assembled rom, and back again. I figured that
being able to recover a project from a rom and its symbols file has important
potential in terms of data preservation. To make this possible, I modified the
<a href='symbols.html'>symbols file</a> to include comments, and was able to
complete the back and forth I wanted.</p>
	<p>This allowed me to experiment with something called <a

there, and didn't return until the fall. We left with stores bursting with <a

without the need to resupply.</p>

<p>The year was beginning and I hadn't entirely made up my mind about <a

want to keep on using, as it often goes with such projects, but the year came
and went without ever finding myself wanting to program in any other

	<p>Continuing my recent experiments with the <a

virtualized step-debugger. It is called <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a>,
after <a href='https://github.com/randrew/uxn32' target='_blank'>Uxn32</a>'s

various emulators and debuggers to add labels to addresses when throwing errors

	<p>We've left <a href='https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html' target='_blank'>Desolation Sound</a>, and stopped in Texada to reprovision before sailing south. We finally have access to reliable internet access again, but none of my <a href='bookmarks.html'>near-endless supply</a> of things to catch up on, none of it stirs any interest in me right now.</p>
	<p>Despite my unsettled moods, I was able to built myself a cozy little world to work from, the operating system turned out to be extremly useful in looking through my large collection of pcm, chr and icn files.</p>

<h2>2021</h2>

<p>The pandemic restrictions forced us to stay at one place, if only for a moment. To stop running and possibly build something, to spend more time with the same people and to become familiar with our surroundings. Every year is meant to be my <a href='https://www.raptitude.com/2018/12/why-the-depth-year-was-my-best-year/' target='_blank'>depth year</a>, every January, I tell myself that this time, finally, I will look deeper into things. I typically don't follow through, and this year might not have been as deep a year as I had hoped, but I can say that my understanding of a few specific things have deepened.</p>

<p>By the year's end, I, along with a handful of amazing people, had brought a little <a href='uxntal.html'>programming language</a> into the world, it cannot do much at all, but building this project brought me closer to understanding the deeper questions I had about programming, especially how human-language maps to symbols that computers can understand.</p>

<img loading='lazy' src='../media/diary/399.jpg'/>

<p>Between the air that's hard to breath due to forest fires, and the water rationing that stops us from filling up our tanks, the tumbling down of everything has, to my surprise, not paralyzed me as much as I expected. It has been a constant creative force that pushed me through the year to learn about food preservation, water purification, insulation, heating, and various endeavors that I had previously overlooked, and that might come in handy would things keep on deteriorating.</p>

<p>Among the more trivial things that brought me joy this year, I've successfully grown a large lion's mane mushroom aboard the boat, worked on a wonderful tribute of the <a href='catclock.html'>catclock</a> with Rekka, did plenty of <a href='origami.html'>origami</a> with our friend's kids and played accordion for the first time.</p>

<p>For the year of 2021, Edward Abbey's The Monkey Wrench Gang, was my favourite <a href='reading.html'>book</a>. The Lobster was my favourite <a href='watching.html'>movie</a>. Tamaryn's Dreaming The Dark was my favourite <a href='listening.html'>album</a>. </p>

the lack of focus, have been fixed and the data gathered in these recent years
reveals nothing new or actionable. A bi-monthly format where I write a few
sentences on my recent interests might be more practical.</p>
